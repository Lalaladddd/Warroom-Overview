# Warroom 🎮🪖

**Warroom** is an interactive Virtual Reality tactical battlefield game built with Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit.  
Players take on the role of a **giant commander**, placing miniature tanks and soldiers into a virtual battlefield, where AI-driven armies fight each other.  

The goal is to deliver an immersive **tabletop wargame experience in VR** — blending tactical strategy, sandbox creativity, and AI-driven combat.
